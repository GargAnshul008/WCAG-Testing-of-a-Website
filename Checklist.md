##Checklist for manual examination using Keyboard Navigation for all websites:

**[] Keyboard focus: ENSURE that:**

  - The focus order follows the visual order of the web page.

  - All functionalities are easy to use and available using the keyboard itself.

  - No element should be escaped via keyboard alone.

  - Visibility at all times for all browsers/device, *FOR users with low vision or color blindness.*

  - Whenever a user changes focus on the web page, there is no change of context.

  - The ARIA 1.1 Authoring Practices are followed for the interactions.

  - Keyboard shortcuts are avoided. *If at all they are implemented, they should not interfere with any browser shortcuts or other screen readers, and can be turned off.*

  - Meaningful and easy order.
  

**[] Tab order:**

  - See if you can activate all interactive elements with Enter and Space keys.

  - Tab order should be logical. It should be left to right and top to bottom.

  - All elements on the page can be reached by keyboard. This includes drop downs, menu items, buttons and other interactive elements.

  - Users can select the menu items or drop down items with the keyboard.
  

**[] Forms:**

  - Tab order of forms should be logical.

  - If there is a drop down menu, users should be able to navigate and select items using keyboard alone.

  - Data entered should be retained if the page is refreshed or too much time is taken to fill out the form fields.

  - If a required field is left blank, keyboard focus should shift to that field when the user is notified.

  - As soon as you submit the form and an error appears on the field, keyboard focus should be set on that field.
  

**[] Dialog box and pop-ups:**

  - As soon as the dialog opens up, keyboard focus should be set on the dialog or pop-up.

  - Dialog can be dismissed using keyboard.

  - When the pop-up is closed, focus should be set on the element which activated the dialog on the parent page.


**[] Multimedia Controls:** *For video, audio, and animated carousels (sliders or slideshow).*

  - Manual control exists for play/pause/hide.

  - Controls can be activated using the keyboard and tabbed through.
